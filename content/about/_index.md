This is the home of some practical lab courses developed by Dr Tom Howard, a University Teacher at the University of Sheffield. The material here is designed for teaching **ROS (the Robot Operating System)**, and has been developed to support a range of **practical teaching activities** that take place in [The Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond) for a range of different undergraduate degree courses.

This material was primarily designed, by Tom, for **COM2009 "Robotics"**: a second-year Computer Science module led by [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs). It's grown a bit over the last couple of years though, and we're now also using this site to support the teaching of a masters-level module for the department of [Automatic Control and Systems Engineering](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse) (**ACS6121**), and some labs for an [AMRC Training Centre](https://amrctraining.co.uk/) module (**AMR31001**).

If you're here as part of one of these courses then *welcome*! You can find the relevant course material under your module code in the Nav Bar on the left-hand side of the page. We hope that this site might also be useful for others hoping to learn ROS too though, so feel free to have a look around... we hope you find it useful!

The courses here are designed to teach you how to use ROS to program robots, using a mix of simulation-based learning and real robot hardware. Typically, we start in simulation first, and we've got [a WSL-based simulation environment that we use for this (coming soon)](). Everything you'll learn in simulation is directly applicable to real robots too though, and - on all of these courses - you'll be able to apply your new-found ROS knowledge to the real TurtleBot3 Waffle Robots that we have in The Diamond.
