This is the home of some practical lab courses developed by Dr Tom Howard, a University Teacher at the University of Sheffield. The materials here are designed for teaching **ROS (the Robot Operating System)**.

These materials are designed for undergraduate students taking a range of different courses at the University of Sheffield. Everything here is designed to support **practical teaching activities** that take place in [the Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond) as part of these courses.

The materials were primarily designed, by Tom, for a second-year Computer Science module called **COM2009 "Robotics"**. It's grown a bit over the last couple of years though, and we're now also using this site to support the teaching of a masters-level module for the department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering (**ACS6121**), and a small part of a module for the AMRC Training Centre (**AMR31001**).

If you're here as part of one of these courses then Welcome! You can find the relevant course materials under your module code in the Nav Bar on the left-hand side of the page. We hope that this site might also be useful for others hoping to learn ROS too though, so feel free to have a look around... we hope you find it useful!

The courses here are designed to teach you how to use ROS to program robots. You'll learn this using a mix of simulation-based learning and real robot hardware. Typically, we start in simulation first, and we've got [a WSL-based simulation environment that we use for this(TODO)](). Everything you'll learn will be directly applicable to real robots too though, and - on all of our courses - you'll be able to applying your new-found ROS knowledge to the real TurtleBot3 Waffle Robots that we have in The Diamond.
