## The Lab

### Getting Started

launching ROS...

downloading the "AMR31001 Repo"


### Odometry System (explainer)

Discuss all the sensors on board the robot that can be used to inform control...



#### Exercise 1: Odometry-based Turning

Demonstrate how to use odometry to control the turn angle, then ask the students to do the same for forward velocity...


### The LiDAR Sensor

#### Exercise 2: Wall detection




#### Exercise 3: SLAM and Navigation




### The Camera

#### Exercise 4: Object Tracking with PID??

(maybe a simulation-based exercise, to make life easier?)
