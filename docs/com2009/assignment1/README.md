    *In this first part you will learn the basics of ROS and become familiar with some key tools and principles of this framework, allowing you to program robots and work with ROS applications effectively.*

* [Part 2: Odometry & Navigation](./part2)

    *In this session you'll learn about Odometry data, which informs us of a robot's position in an environment. You'll also learn how to control a ROS robot's velocity (and thus its position) using both open and closed-loop control methods.*
