## Team Robotics Challenge

In Lab Assignment #2 you will put into practice everything that you have learnt about ROS so far, and explore the capabilities of the framework further.

For the rest of the Semester (Weeks 7-12) you will work **in teams** to develop a ROS package to make a TurtleBot3 Waffle complete a series of robotic tasks in both simulation and the real world. There are **five tasks** to complete in total, all of which you will be assessed on as part of Lab Assignment #2.

This assignment is worth 30% of the overall mark for the COM2009 (& COM3009) course.
